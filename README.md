# Software Design Pattern ##


> In order to achieve loose coupling, we should avoid
tightly-coupled classes to make it through IoC Principle.

_to reach an IoC, we have different ways but the best way to do is_ `DIP`,
`DI principle` + `Factory Pattern`

Hint: If you want to do TDD, you MUST perform IoC principle.

we addressed 4 issues in this principle [ IoC ]

	1. rename/add/remove the methods of BusinessLogic
	2. Factory pattern to reach an IoC principle
	3. removing the new keyword
	4. DI Principle - using 3 methods
		4.1. Constructor Injection
		4.2. Property Injection
		4.3. Method Injection
	5. Removing the concrete DataAccess Class using DIP.
