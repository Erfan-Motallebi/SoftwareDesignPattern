# Software Design Pattern #

_Singleton pattern comes under the Creational Pattern Catalog_

Hint: There are some ways to implement the Singleton

1.	Lazy Instantiation Approach [Not Recommended - non-thread safe ]
2.  Synchronized Approach [ Not recommended -  although thread-safe but the overhead of locking mechanism]
3.	Volatile Approach [ Double Check ] - The best way
4.  Eager Instantiation Approach [ better way of Singleton Pattern ]sssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
